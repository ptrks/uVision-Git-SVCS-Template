# uVision-Git-SVCS-Template

### Overview
The uVision IDE supports various version control systems with the help of .SVCS template files. Recently they added a template file 
for use with Git. This is my attempt at fixing bugs and adding functionality to the template file.

### Changelog
* Fixed ```Commit staged changes``` entry. Original version was using ```commit -m``` but passing a temp file path.
